I have created the website from the view of a user logging in, in this case it is Lee Robinson login in and within the system he is only allowed to edit his own requests and not allowed to change anyone else's. He can view all applications on the show and index pages but not edit them if not his own


All the pages have been tested on http://validator.w3.org/check and all pass along with the css style sheet
